00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Memories consume like opening the wounds

1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm picking me apart again

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,900
You all assume

3
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,100
I'm safe here in my room

4
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,300
Unless I try to start again

5
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,700
I don't want to be the one the
battles always choose

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,300
'cause inside I realize that
I'm the one confused

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,800
I don't know what's worth fighting for

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,200
Or why I have to scream

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,600
I don't know why I instigate

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,000
And say what I don't mean

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,500
I don't know how I got this way

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,500
I know it's not alright

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,600
So I'm breaking the habit

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:15,800
I'm breaking the habit tonight

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,000
Clutching my cure

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,100
I tightly lock the door

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,600
I try to catch my breath again

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,600
I hurt much more than any time before

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,900
I have no options left again

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,300
I don't want to be the one the
battles always choose

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,100
'cause inside I realize that
I'm the one confused

22
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,600
I don't know what's worth fighting for

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,700
Or why I have to scream

24
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,200
I don't know why I instigate

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,500
And say what I don't mean

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't know how I got this way

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,100
I'll never be alright

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,000
So I'm breaking the habit

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,200
I'm breaking the habit tonight

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll paint it on the walls

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,700
'cause I'm the one at fault

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,600
I'll never fight again

33
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,200
And this is how it ends

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,600
I don't know what's worth fighting for

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,900
Or why I have to scream

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,700
But now I have some clarity to
show you what I mean

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,100
I don't know how I got this way

38
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
I'll never be alright

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,300
So I'm breaking the habit

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm breaking the habit

41
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:01,200
I'm breaking the habit tonight
